An automatic street light system using Arduino in embedded systems is a smart solution designed to conserve energy by controlling street lights based on ambient light levels. The system utilizes an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect the surrounding light intensity, turning the street lights on at dusk and off at dawn. By integrating Arduino, the system can be easily programmed to respond accurately to changing light conditions, ensuring optimal energy usage while maintaining safety and visibility on the streets. This project is a practical application of embedded systems, combining sensors and microcontroller programming for real-world benefits.
